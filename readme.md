Free Code Camp Project: Pomodoro Clock


Build a clock that will count down and go off when timer has elapsed. Make it able to be reset for the next pomodoro. The length of each pomodoro should be customizable.


The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are called pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro, which means tomato.[2] The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.  --  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique
